Store your code in this folder. When you modify the code, you can "commit" your changes and then "push" them to GitHub. Your updates will be visible on GitHub, allowing team members to view the modifications you've made and download your most recent code (or an earlier version if they prefer). This process will significantly speed up code sharing and simplify organization, along with maintaining a version history.
